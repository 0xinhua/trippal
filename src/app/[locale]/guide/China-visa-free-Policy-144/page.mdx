# How many days can I stay under China's visa-free transit policy?

In a publicly available e-book survey questionnaire, many Australian residents have inquired about the specific provisions of China's visa-free policy for Australians such as:

- In which cities can one stay with a 144-hour visa-free transit?
- How to calculate the 144 hours?
- Which ports of entry are available?
- How to plan a trip reasonably within 144 hours?

This article will introduce and answer these questions.

Announcement from the Chinese Government Website on July 17, 2024: China has expanded its unilateral visa-free entry policy to travelers from 38 countries, allowing stays of up to 30 days. In the latest policy update announced on December 17, 2025, China has introduced more visa-free transit ports. Additionally, travelers can now visit multiple destinations within a single trip.

Update: Starting from December 17, 2024, the National Immigration Administration has comprehensively relaxed and optimized the visa-free transit policy, extending the stay duration for visa-free transit foreigners in the country from the original 72 and 144 hours to 240 hours (10 days), while also adding 21 new ports of entry for visa-free transit personnel and further expanding the areas where they can stay and engage in activities.

Citizens of 54 countries can stay for up to 72 or 144 hours in the specified areas without a visa, provided they have a valid international travel document and a confirmed onward ticket with a fixed date and seat within the set time frame, for transit through the aforementioned cities to a third country (region). During their stay, they can engage in short-term activities such as tourism and temporary business visits.
